org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan


Configures component scanning directives for use with @Configuration classes.Provides support parallel with Spring XML's <context:component-scan> element. 

Either basePackageClasses or basePackages (or its alias value) may be specified to define specific packages to scan. If specificpackages are not defined, scanning will occur from the package of theclass that declares this annotation. 

Note that the <context:component-scan> element has an annotation-config attribute; however, this annotation does not. This is becausein almost all cases when using @ComponentScan, default annotation configprocessing (e.g. processing @Autowired and friends) is assumed. Furthermore,when using AnnotationConfigApplicationContext, annotation config processors arealways registered, meaning that any attempt to disable them at the @ComponentScan level would be ignored. 

See @Configuration's Javadoc for usage examples.
